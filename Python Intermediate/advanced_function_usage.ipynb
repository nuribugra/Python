    "In Python, nested functions are a powerful concept where you define a function within another function. This allows you to create more structured and modular code. By utilizing nested functions, you can break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable parts. These inner functions can access variables from the outer function, facilitating data encapsulation and enhancing code readability. Nested functions are a valuable tool in your Python programming toolkit."

This concept of returning functions opens up opportunities for more dynamic and flexible programming. By returning functions, you can create higher-order functions, which are functions that can accept other functions as arguments and, in turn, return new functions as results. This can be particularly useful in situations where you need to customize or adapt a function's behavior based on certain conditions or inputs. Returning functions is a fundamental feature in Python, enabling you to write more modular and reusable code."
