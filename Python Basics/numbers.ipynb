    "In Python, when you perform a division operation, the result is automatically converted to a float. This happens because Python ensures that division maintains precision and accuracy, even when dealing with whole numbers. So, whether you're dividing two integers or an integer by a float, the result will be a float to provide a more accurate representation of the division's outcome. This automatic conversion helps avoid losing precision during calculations and ensures reliable results in your code."
